📊 Spreadsheet Application – Functional Programming Project
This project is a mini spreadsheet application built with a functional programming approach. It focuses on breaking down logic into reusable, composable functions to process and display spreadsheet data dynamically in the browser.

🚀 What You’ll Learn
Functional Programming Concepts
Use of map(), find(), includes(), and parseInt() to build modular, pure functions.

Expression Parsing & Evaluation
Learn to parse and compute user-inputted mathematical expressions.

Custom Spreadsheet Functions
Implement features like sum, average, median, random, range, and more, including handling edge cases.

Cell References & Data Flow
Handle references across cells and update values in real-time.

Interactive Web UI
Build a dynamic interface that updates based on user inputs without page reloads.

🛠 Key Features
Support for multiple spreadsheet functions (sum, average, etc.)

Real-time updates and data reactivity

Edge-case handling using a default identity function

Clean and modular function-based logic

📁 Structure
spreadsheetFunctions.js: Contains all the spreadsheet logic in a functional style

index.html / style.css: Simple interface to interact with the spreadsheet
