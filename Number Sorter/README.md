📊 Number Sorter - Visualizing Sorting Algorithms with JavaScript
Welcome to the Number Sorter project! This interactive web-based tool is designed to help you learn, implement, and visualize fundamental sorting algorithms using JavaScript.

🚀 Project Overview
Sorting algorithms are a foundational topic in computer science, and understanding how they work is key to mastering data manipulation and optimization. This project demonstrates how different sorting techniques operate under the hood by providing visual representations of:

🫧 Bubble Sort

📥 Selection Sort

✍️ Insertion Sort

These classic algorithms are implemented in plain JavaScript and animated within a browser-based UI to show step-by-step comparisons and swaps of numbers in real-time.
