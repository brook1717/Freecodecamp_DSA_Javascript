# 🕹️ Platformer Game Project

Coding a game is a great way to grasp fundamental programming principles while creating an interactive experience.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This project is designed to help you learn and apply core programming concepts in a fun and practical way:

- **Classes & Objects** – Structure your game using object-oriented programming.
- **Inheritance & Encapsulation** – Create reusable game entities with clean, organized code.
- **Game Design & Architecture** – Learn how to manage game elements efficiently.
- **Problem-Solving** – Develop logic to handle game rules, events, and interactions.
- **Code Reusability** – Build components that can be used across different parts of the game.

## 🚀 Features

- Player movement and physics
- Checkpoints and level progression
- Interactive environments and collision detection

## 🎯 Goal

By the end of this project, you'll not only have built a working platformer game, but also improved your skills in software design and game logic implementation.
